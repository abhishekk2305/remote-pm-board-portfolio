## üß≠ User Stories & Flows

- **As a remote PM,** I want to log in with any email so I can see my projects (demo).
- **As a user,** I want to select a project and see its Kanban board.
- **As a user,** I can add a task and move tasks between "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done" statuses.
- **As a PM,** I can view wireframes and user flows for the product development process.

## üìù Notes

- *Wireframes and product design process are included for review in the repo, not the live app.*
- *Backend is a demo Flask API with sample endpoints. Not currently wired to live frontend.*
- *This project is a solo proof-of-concept, not a commercial SaaS.*
